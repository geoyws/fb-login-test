    <h1>Welcome to Weltanschauung! George's personal blogging and social media client!</h1>
    <p>She calls only APIs! And you can do everything you can do on Facebook and Twitter and Blogger/Wordpress or your own blogging system and more! It comes with her own blogging system written in Node.js/Mongo and later she will be able to do instant messaging and a wiki and community Q&A  system just for practice's sake and familiarity's sake! And also GIS systems for location based services! And also GIS-ish things. Then afterwards, I will be able to show off my work to clients and my dad and I will be able to do well when the processes are scalable and very strong! When performance is awesome! And proven! And she will run on mobile devices as well!</p>
